- 全局速度导数，**An important example of a material derivative is Dv/Dt, the rate of change ofvelocity following the flow** [068](bookxnotepro://opennote/?nb={7eeb44c3-6948-459b-a29c-63e46dbbc7ec}&book=c00a3c7aa02860194e44137ec79fb095&page=67&x=220&y=69&id=66)

- **it should be mentioned that the Eulerian approach introduces into the conservation equations the local effect of transport by the fluid flow through the advective rate of change term, which represents the product of an unknown velocity field and the gradient of an unknown variable field. This nonlinearity leads to the most interesting and most challenging phenomena of fluid flows.** [068](bookxnotepro://opennote/?nb={7eeb44c3-6948-459b-a29c-63e46dbbc7ec}&book=c00a3c7aa02860194e44137ec79fb095&page=67&x=220&y=287&id=69)
