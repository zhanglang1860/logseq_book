- **a critical short-coming of the Lagrangian approach is its inability to control the domain of interest since fluid parcels travel to where the flow takes them, which may not be the region of interest. This limits the usefulness of the approach as in most fluid flow applications fluid properties in a fixed region are required, e.g., the shear stress on the surface of a moving train, and not the properties of moving material volumes.** [068](bookxnotepro://opennote/?nb={7eeb44c3-6948-459b-a29c-63e46dbbc7ec}&book=c00a3c7aa02860194e44137ec79fb095&page=67&x=220&y=221&id=68)
